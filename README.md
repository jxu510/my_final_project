# Haiti

This is my final project on Haiti.

## Administrative Subdivisions of Haiti

![](details3.0.png)

Haiti is divided administratively into 10 departments: Artibonite, Centre, Grand'Anse, Nippes, Nord, Nord-Est, Nord-Ouest, Ouest, Sud-Est and Sud. The country is further subdivied into 42 arrondissements (a specific level of administrative division in Haiti), including Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, Bainet, etc.

The region that I picked is West (Detail A), also known as "Ouest" and North-East (Detail B). Unlike its name indicates, the west department is located in the east part of Haiti. This department includes the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, and thus, is the most populated area among the country due to the relatively developed economy. Like the name tells, the North-East department is located in the northeastern of Haiti, which is a historic site of colonial plantations and a main place for the cultivation of chestnuts.

## Population of Haiti's Countries

According to the bar chart on the left, there's no big difference in the population except for Ouest and L'Artibonite, which accounts for more than 55 percent of population in Haiti, showing the particular area of concentrated population.

## Population of Haiti's Districts

According to the population plot above, the most obvious red part is where Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince is located in. Meanwhile, due to the impact of this subdivision, the nearby cities are also having a relatively densed population, compared to other parts. Except for this specific area, population is kind of evenly distributed among the country cause there's no particular difference in color, as shown on the plot.


## Population of Haiti_3D plot

The three-dimentional plot presents the population among the country in a more visible way. From the plot, we can infer that except for West and the department around it, the population is mostly distributed in an even way. 

## Histograms with different variables

Two histograms with variables indicate that there's one region with particularly high use of night time lights, further confriming the previous estimated of population.

## The Regression Model

The R square value I got is very close to 1, which shows the accuracy of the estimated method. However, this might also be due to the size of data collected is relatively small compared to other country's.

## Three Prediction Methods - 1
Response variable is population and the predictors are mean of covariates

## Three Prediction Method - 2
Response variable is population and the predictors are sums of covariates

## Three Prediction Method - 3
Response variable is log of population and the predictors are mean of covariates
