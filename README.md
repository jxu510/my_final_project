# Haiti

This is my final project on Haiti.

## Administrative Subdivisions of Haiti

Haiti is divided administratively into 10 departments: Artibonite, Centre, Grand'Anse, Nippes, Nord, Nord-Est, Nord-Ouest, Ouest, Sud-Est and Sud. The country is further subdivied into 42 arrondissements (a specific level of administrative division in Haiti), including Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, Bainet, etc.

The region that I picked is South-East (Detail A) and North-East (Detail B). South-East department includes its capital city Port-au-Prince, and is the most populated area among the country. The North-East department is a historic site of colonial plantations and a main place for the cultivation of chestnuts.
